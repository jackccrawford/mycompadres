# AI Session Handoff Prompt

## Project Context
The mVara Hub React Native app has just undergone a round of UI/UX consistency updates.

## Key Accomplishments
- All bottom tab screens (Home, Wins, Edge, Blueprint, Insights) now display a consistent branded header (mVara logo on the left, theme toggle on the right) by default via Tab.Navigator `screenOptions`.
- Footer and CTA button consistency across all tabs has been verified and documented.
- Code, documentation, and CTA_BUTTONS_TABLE.md have been updated to reflect these changes.
- See `EXECUTIVE_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md` for a summary of recent progress.

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
- Continue to ensure any new tabs or navigation changes inherit the default branded header.
- Maintain consistency for future UI/UX changes.
- Reference the CTA_BUTTONS_TABLE.md and EXECUTIVE_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md for the current state of completion and areas to focus on next.

**Both CTA_BUTTONS_TABLE.md and EXECUTIVE_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md have been updated to reflect the latest UI/UX and CTA consistency work.**
